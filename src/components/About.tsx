          <p>
            Singapore Youth AI was established in 2023, culminating from members
            of multiple student groups under AI Singaporeâ€™s student outreach
            program. Our foundation was inspired by the vibrant engagements and
            discussions within the AI community, where many young enthusiasts
            gathered yet lacked a unified platform. From our initial eight
            members, we've grown into a thriving community of 600 youths and we
            only continue to grow!
          </p>
          <p>
            Recognizing this gap, we aim to serve as the hub for youth
            interested in AI, providing a collective space to harness and direct
            our passion towards impactful, Singapore-focused AI initiatives. Our
            journey began with the mission to connect, empower, and advance
            young talents in AI, making their noble aspirations actionable and
            impactful.
